# calculator
Fully functional, basic calculator. For use on a web browser!

This calculator was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of The Odin
Project full stack JavaScript curriculum.

In the future, I'd like to add support for multiple consecutive 'equals' presses
that would keep the original second operator but update the first operator to the
new total.
